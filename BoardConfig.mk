# From https://source.android.com/devices/tech/security/selinux
# In the Android 5.0 (L) release, Android moves to full enforcement of 
# SELinux. This builds upon the permissive release of 4.3 and the partial
# enforcement of 4.4. In short, Android is shifting from enforcement on a 
# limited set of crucial domains (installd, netd, vold and zygote) to 
# everything (more than 60 domains). This means manufacturers will have to 
# better understand and scale their SELinux implementations to provide 
# compatible devices. Understand that:

# Everything is in enforcing mode in the 5.0 release
# No processes other than init should run in the init domain
# Any generic denial (for a block_device, socket_device, default_service, 
# etc.) indicates that device needs a special domain

# Currently running the emulator with this disabled:
# IE emulator -selinux disabled
